Please find all of the plots we have created for the analyses. 

Presentation plots have been designed to suit the aspect ratio of PowerPoint while report plots have been designed have relatively larger text to they are visible within a Word document.

Most of these plots were included within either the presentation and reprot but some are from extra analysis that was not included.
